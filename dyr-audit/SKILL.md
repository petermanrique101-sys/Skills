# DYR Audit

Use this skill when the user asks for a DYR audit, "do your research" audit, legitimacy check, due-diligence review, scam check, vendor/product trust review, or pre-purchase/investment sanity check.

## Goal
Produce a concise, evidence-backed risk assessment that helps Peter decide whether to trust, use, buy from, partner with, or investigate a person, company, product, website, app, crypto project, vendor, or offer.

## Inputs to collect
If not already provided, ask for the target and context:
- Target name, website, handle, product, offer, or person
- What decision Peter is considering: buy, invest, sign up, partner, contact, ignore, etc.
- Any specific concern: scam, pricing, security, adult-content compliance, reviews, API reliability, legal risk, etc.

Do not ask unnecessary questions if the target is clear. Start researching.

## Research workflow
1. Identify the canonical target
   - Find the official website/domain and main social/business profiles.
   - Watch for lookalike domains, paid ads, cloned sites, and impersonators.
   - If multiple entities share the same name, clarify or separate them.

2. Legitimacy and ownership
   - Check domain age/WHOIS-style signals when available.
   - Look for company legal name, address, leadership, support contacts, terms, privacy policy, refunds, and pricing.
   - Verify whether the business identity is consistent across website, socials, marketplaces, app stores, and directories.

3. Reputation scan
   - Search for reviews, complaints, Reddit/forum discussions, BBB/Trustpilot/app store reviews, lawsuits, enforcement actions, scam reports, and support issues.
   - Separate recurring patterns from one-off angry reviews.
   - Note when results are thin or suspiciously SEO-manipulated.

4. Claim verification
   - List major claims the target makes.
   - Check whether independent sources support those claims.
   - Flag vague, unverifiable, exaggerated, or urgency-heavy claims.

5. Security/privacy/compliance checks
   - Review login/payment flow, HTTPS, privacy policy, data handling, subscription terms, cancellation path, and refund policy.
   - For API/SaaS tools: check docs quality, status page, auth model, pricing limits, support channels, and recent activity.
   - For adult, supplement, finance, crypto, health, or regulated niches: call out special compliance risk.

6. Risk scoring
   Score 0–10 for:
   - Legitimacy / identity confidence
   - Reputation
   - Offer/pricing transparency
   - Security/privacy posture
   - Fit for Peter’s intended use

7. Recommendation
   Give a direct verdict:
   - Green: reasonable to proceed
   - Yellow: proceed carefully / small test only
   - Red: avoid or do not provide money/credentials

## Output format
Use this structure:

# DYR Audit: [Target]

**Verdict:** Green / Yellow / Red — one-sentence reason.

**Bottom line:** 2–4 direct sentences with the practical answer.

## Key findings
- Finding with source/context
- Finding with source/context
- Finding with source/context

## Risk scorecard
| Area | Score | Notes |
|---|---:|---|
| Legitimacy / identity | x/10 | ... |
| Reputation | x/10 | ... |
| Pricing / terms | x/10 | ... |
| Security / privacy | x/10 | ... |
| Fit for intended use | x/10 | ... |

## Red flags
- Only include real red flags found. If none, say “No major red flags found from available sources.”

## Green flags
- Evidence that increases confidence.

## Open questions
- Anything important that could not be verified.

## Recommendation
Concrete next step: proceed, avoid, contact support, use a virtual card, test with a small order, request docs, etc.

## Rules
- Do not overstate certainty. If evidence is thin, say so.
- Always distinguish verified facts from inference.
- Cite/source claims in plain English; include URLs when helpful.
- Do not call something a scam unless evidence supports it; say “risk indicators” when uncertain.
- For irreversible actions, credentials, payment, or signup, stop and get Peter’s confirmation before proceeding.
- Keep it concise unless Peter asks for a deep report.
